This exceptional melding of environments has resulted in the creation of a unique ecological nesting and breeding grounds for hundreds of bird species.<br><br> The sanctuary benefits from an ancient system of giant manmade tanks built in the 12th century, each connected to the other and working in tandem to form a complex irrigation system that sustains its paddy fields and local vegetation, while simultaneously creating a natural habitat for the birds that build their homes in the area.<br> The Wetlands are home to more than 150 species of birds; 20 species of mammals; 70 species of butterflies; and more than 50% of Sri Lanka’s freshwater fish species.<br><br>",
